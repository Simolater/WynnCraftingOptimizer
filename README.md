# WynnCraftingOptimizer
A WIP crafting optimizer for the Minecraft Mmorpg Server "Wynncraft". https://wynncraft.com/

The aim of this project is to generate stat optimized crafting configurations using user defined heuristic functions.
An example of how a craft looks like: https://hppeng-wynn.github.io/crafter/#196679F5+5+5+9Z91 

Crafting-Ingredients are parsed in a sub project and translated into a header file. This is used to enable compiletime preprocessing to improve performance.
